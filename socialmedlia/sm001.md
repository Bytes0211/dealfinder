Just wrapped up Phase 1 of my Deal Finder project and honestly? Pretty happy so far....so far 

So here's the deal - I've been working on turning a messy Jupyter notebook prototype into a real production system.

My wife is always shopping for a deal.
So this is an AI-powered deal hunter that scrapes RSS feeds, estimates actual prices using ensemble ML models, and sends you real-time notifications when legit deals pop up. Think "find the best price for that laptop you've been eyeing" but automated and smart enough to know when a 'sale' is actually a sale.

What I have accomplish so far:
• Spun up 47 AWS resources with Terraform (because clicking around the console is not my thing)
• Built out a proper VPC across 3 availability zones
• Got CI/CD running with GitHub Actions - linting, testing, the works
• Added CloudWatch monitoring so I actually know when things break
• Wrote 97 tests that all pass (yeah, I'm bragging a little)

The cool part? I'm only spending $4-10/month right now thanks to some research resulting in some smart architecture choices.
Turns out you don't need a NAT Gateway when VPC endpoints exist. Who knew?

Next up: migrating from ChromaDB to OpenSearch and setting up Aurora.
Then the real fun begins - getting Kafka and Spark running for real-time deal hunting.

Tech stack if you're curious: AWS, Terraform, Python 3.12, GitHub Actions. Planning to add Apache Kafka and Spark soon.

Building in public is wild. New to me. Feels awkward. Let's see where this goes!
